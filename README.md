#securenote
securenote is a tech demo site made to demonstrate how end-to-end encryption may be used. 

It works by generating a locally stored private key in your localStorage, and then using that in conjunction with a code and passphrase to lookup a note. 

Notes are stored encrypted in the DB, and there is no way to decrypt without knowing the locally stored key on the users' machine.
